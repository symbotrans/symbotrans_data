fonetiktranslat√∏r (fotrans)
===========================

fotrans is basically a set of data to be used with
[symbotrans](https://github.com/abelbabel/symbotrans), the symbol
translator. With this data set symbotrans will get an application that
can translate between mulitple phonetic transcription systems used in
the danish laguage.

To use this data set, replace the data/ directory of your symbotrans
instance with this. You might want to define and provide some proper
fonts in the fonts/ subdirectory.
